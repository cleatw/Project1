How does Microsoft go about Rating the movie and does that effect sales? What we want to avoid is creating movies where the earnings recieved enderperfrom our budget. For instance in our research, we discovered some recent movies that vastly underperfromed their production budgets. According to [Work and Money](https://www.workandmoney.com/s/biggest-box-office-bombs-movie-flops-8225f2e154084d6b) , movies such as Black Widow and The Mummy(2017) lost over **half** of their budget cost.
