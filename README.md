 ### Business Understanding
Microsoft is a muiltnational corporation known for producing software, electronics , computers, video games and so on. Microsoft now plans to venture into film and movie production. We want to ensure this entry is succesful. Some key questions we answered include: What movies bring in maximum earnings ? What kind of directors should Microsoft pursue? How does Microsoft go about Rating the movie and does that effect sales? What we want to avoid is creating movies where the earnings recieved enderperfrom our budget. For instance in our research, we discovered some recent movies that vastly underperfromed their production budgets. According to [Work and Money](https://www.workandmoney.com/s/biggest-box-office-bombs-movie-flops-8225f2e154084d6b) , movies such as Black Widow and The Mummy(2017) lost over **half** of their budget cost.
